      <h2>Angular Compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        To use AG Grid with Angular, you will need to install the ag-grid-angular package from npm and import it into your Angular module. You will also need to import the AgGridModule and call AgGridModule.withComponents([]) to register any custom cell renderers or editors that you may have.

        Here's an example of how to import AG Grid into an Angular module:
      </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/angularCompatibility.PNG">
      <p>
        In this example, we have imported AgGridModule from ag-grid-angular and called AgGridModule.withComponents([]) to register any custom cell renderers or editors. We have also imported AppComponent and declared it in the module.

    <h2>Columns</h2>
    <section class="content3" id="Columns">
      
      <section id="endpoints--root">
        <h3>Column Definition </h3>
        <p>
          Column definition is an object that defines the properties and behavior of a column in the grid. A column definition is typically defined as an array of objects, with each object representing a column. 

          Here is an example of a column definition object: 
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/coldefTsfile.PNG">
        <p>
          In this example, columnDefs is an array of column definitions, with each object representing a column. The properties of each column definition include: 

          headerName: The text to display in the column header. 

          field: The name of the property in the data that will be displayed in the column. 

          sortable: Whether the column can be sorted. 

          filter: Whether the column can be filtered. 

          The above code defines four columns: "Make", "Model", "Year", and "Price". Each column is sortable and filterable, and the data to display in each column will come from the make, model, year, and price properties of the data objects. 

          Column definitions can also include additional properties to configure more advanced features of AG Grid, such as grouping, aggregation, and formatting. By defining columns separately from the data, you can create more flexible and reusable grid configurations. 

          Once a column definition is defined, it can be passed to the ag-grid-angular component as a property, like this:
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/coldefHtmlfile.PNG">
        <p>
          This will create a grid with the columns defined in the columnDefs array, using the row data defined in the rowData array.
        </p>
                          
      </section>


      <section id="endpoints--cities-overview">
        <h3>Column Groups </h3>
        <p>
          Column grouping is a powerful feature in AG Grid for Angular that allows developers to group related columns together and display them as a single header. Column grouping can be used to create more organized and structured grids, particularly when dealing with large data sets.

          To define a column group in AG Grid for Angular, we can use a Column Definition object that has a children property. The children property is an array of child Column Definition objects that define the columns to be included in the group. The parent Column Definition object specifies the properties of the group header.

          Here's an example of a column group:
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/colgpTsfile.PNG">
        <p>
          In this example, we have defined two column groups: "Personal Info" and "Location Info". Each group has its own header and contains child columns.

          To display the grid with column groups, we can pass the columnDefs array to the ag-grid-angular component as a property, like this:
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/colgpHtmlfile.PNG">
        <p>
          AG Grid also provides several features for working with column groups, such as collapsing and expanding the groups, sorting and filtering within the groups, and applying styles to the group headers.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="endpoints--city-detail">
        <h3>Column Moving </h3>
        <p>
          Column Moving in AG Grid for Angular allows users to move columns to different positions in the grid by dragging and dropping them with the mouse. This feature is useful when working with large datasets where users may want to view specific data in a particular order.

          By default, column moving is enabled in AG Grid, and users can move columns by clicking and dragging on the column header. When a column is being moved, a preview of the column is shown, and a drop zone is displayed where the column can be dropped.

          You can also customize the behavior of column moving by configuring the following properties in the column definition:

          movable: Set to false to disable moving for a specific column.
          lockPosition: Set to true to prevent a column from being moved out of its initial position.
          suppressMovableColumns: Set to true on the grid options to disable column moving for all columns.
          Here's an example of how to disable moving for a specific column:
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/colmovTsfile.PNG">
        <p>
          In this example, the "Year" column is not movable, so users will not be able to drag it to a different position in the grid.
        </p>

      <section id="endpoints--city-config">
        <h3>Column Spanning </h3>
        <p>
          Column Spanning in AG Grid for Angular allows you to merge cells in the header row of the grid, which can be useful for displaying hierarchical data or for creating complex header structures.

          To span columns, you need to define the columns as a group and set the headerName property to an object containing the name and mergeAcross properties. The name property is the display name of the group, and the mergeAcross property specifies the number of columns to span.
          
          Here's an example of how to span two columns using column grouping:
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/colspanTsfile.PNG">
        <p>
          In this example, the "Make" column is pinned to the left, so it will remain fixed in its position while the other columns scroll horizontally.

          You can also pin multiple columns by setting the pinned property to 'left' or 'right' for each column. Additionally, you can customize the behavior of column pinning by configurinIn this example, the "Details" header is defined as a column group, and the "Price" column has a headerName object with the name property set to "Details" and the mergeAcross property set to 1, which means it will span one column to the right.

          You can also span multiple columns by setting the mergeAcross property to a higher number, or span columns to the left by using a negative number. Additionally, you can customize the behavior of column spanning by configuring other properties in the column definition, such as headerClass and headerGroupComponent.g other properties in the column definition, such as pinnedRowCellRenderer and pinnedRowCellRendererParams.
        </p>

      <section id="endpoints--city-spots-overview">
        <h3>Column Pinning </h3>
        <p>
          Column Pinning in AG Grid for Angular allows users to fix one or more columns to the left or right side of the grid while the other columns scroll horizontally. This feature is useful when working with large datasets where users need to view specific columns at all times.

          By default, column pinning is disabled in AG Grid, and all columns are free to scroll horizontally. To enable column pinning, you can configure the pinned property in the column definition. This property can be set to 'left' or 'right' to pin the column to the left or right side of the grid, respectively.

          Here's an example of how to pin a column to the left:
        </p>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/colpinTsfile.PNG">
